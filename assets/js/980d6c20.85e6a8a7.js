Processing after accepting the invitation: create an Apache account and add the candidate account to the project. After the candidate accepts the invitation, if the candidate does not have an Apache email account, the voting initiator needs to assist the candidate to create an Apache account according to the guidelines. When signing icla, the candidate needs to write the name of Apache links project in the \"notify project:\" column, so that the candidate account can be added to the list of corresponding project personnel by Apache. If the candidate does not join the project, the voting initiator needs to apply to mentor to add project members and open the permission account of Apache project, Confirm that the candidate's Apache account has been added to the project address: http://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?podling=linkis .\n\n7.
